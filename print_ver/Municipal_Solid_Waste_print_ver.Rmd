title: "`r sprintf('Municipal Solid Waste Disposal in B.C. (1990-%s)', max_year)`"
---

This indicator reports the estimated amount of municipal solid waste
disposed per person for each regional district and for British Columbia.
The per-person disposal rate is an estimate of how many kilograms of solid
waste each B.C. resident sends to a landfill or other disposal site in a
given year.

-   Approximately `r round(max_year_total / 1e6, 1)` million tonnes of municipal 
    solid waste was disposed of in B.C. in `r max_year`. While there has been an overall
    decreasing trend in municipal solid waste disposal rates since the
    1990\'s, much of the waste disposed of could be reduced (by not
    being generated in the first place), repurposed, composted or
    recycled.
-   Waste reduction efforts have become more and more important as
    the [B.C. population continues to
    increase](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/sustainability/bc-population.html),
    landfills approach their capacity for receiving new waste, and the
    imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from waste disposal
    grows.
-   Tracking waste disposal across B.C. is important as it provides
    historic trend information and the current status of waste
    disposal---both of which inform and guide efforts to reduce the
    amount of waste we create.
-   In `r max_year`, British Columbians disposed of an
    average of `r round(max_year_rate)` kg of municipal solid
    waste per person---down `r abs(max_year_rate - comp_year_rate)` kg per person from `r comp_year`, though higher 
    than the low of `r min_rate` kg per person in `r min_rate_year`.
-   Provincial initiatives which support decreases in waste disposal
    rates include the CleanBC [Plastics Action Plan](https://engage.gov.bc.ca/app/uploads/sites/121/2019/07/CleanBC_PlasticsActionPlan_ConsultationPaper.pdf), [organics
    diversion](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/waste-management/food-and-organic-waste/organic-waste-diversion), [food
    waste
    prevention](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/waste-management/food-and-organic-waste/prevent-food-waste),
    and [extended producer
    responsibility (recycling)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/waste-management/recycling/extended-producer-responsibility) programs, and funding for [organics infrastructure](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/waste-management/food-and-organic-waste/organic-waste-diversion/organics-infrastructure-program) and [collection](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/waste-management/food-and-organic-waste/organic-waste-diversion/cleanbc-organic-infrastructure-and-collection-program).
-   Variability in disposal rates from one region to the next is
    influenced by factors such as population density, economic activity,
    tourist and transient population fluctuations, distance to recycling
    markets, the role of various stewardship agencies operating in an
    area and the capacity and infrastructure in place in a region. While disposal rate data do not tell the whole story, they are useful in
    setting the stage for continuous improvement in waste management in
    B.C.

The charts below show the estimated per person weight of solid waste
disposed of in `r max_year` for each regional district and the province as a
whole, as well as a history of disposal rates for each region.

#### Interpreting the Data:

-   `r max_year` disposal rates were provided by regional districts.
-   Where no bar is shown on a chart for certain previous years, a
    verifiable estimate was not available.
-   Historic disposal rates cannot be directly compared between years
    because the data were collected using different methods. However,
    the data from `r comp_year` onward have been collected using the same
    methodology.
-   In some cases, waste from light industry may be included in the
    municipal solid waste disposal rate data as it cannot be
    disaggregated.
-   Regional district population estimates are sourced from [BC
    Stats](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=36D1A7A4BEE248598281824C13CB65B6).
    Alberni-Clayoquot, Metro Vancouver, Squamish-Lillooet and East
    Kootenay population estimates have been adjusted to take into account tourist populations, 
    based on data submitted by the regional districts.
-   Disposal rates for Comox Valley and Strathcona are reported as one
    as they handle their waste
    streams [together](http://www.cswm.ca/index.html).
-   The 2020 data for Thompson-Nicola Regional District was corrected as requested 
    by the regional district. The correction decreased the regional district’s total 
    tonnage of waste disposed from 98,949 to 94,972, and the per capita tonnage from 671 to 644.
-   The 2020 data for Regional District of Central Kootenay was also corrected as requested by the regional        district. The correction increased the regional district’s total tonnage of waste disposed from 28,362 to      31,292, and the per capita tonnage from 444 to 490.
-   These two corrections canceled out each other so the total waste tonnage and per capita tonnage for B.C.       did not change for 2020. 

Regional districts that wish to update the waste disposal data reported
above should contact the Environmental Standards Branch. Input from regional districts will
also serve to inform future waste reporting methodology development.
