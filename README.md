# Municipal Solid Waste Disposal in B.C.

A set of R scripts to create the municipal solid waste disposal in B.C. indicator published on [Environmental Reporting BC](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=B71460AF7A8049D59F8CBA6EE18E93B8).

### Data

The data used for the indicator is available from the [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/d21ed158-0ac7-4afd-a03b-ce22df0096bc) under the [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61). Each year's new disposal rate data are provided by regional districts through the completion of the municipal solid waste disposal calculator run by the Environmental Standards Branch in the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy.

### Code

There is one R script, `internal.R` which loads and combines the published 
[open data](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-municipal-solid-waste-disposal-rates) 
with this years yet-to-be published values, and creates the output data files 
to be uploaded to the BC Data Catalogue and subsequently used in the indicator. 
This script requires input data from the Environmental Standards Branch. 

The dataviz folder contains code to create a Shiny app for an interactive 
data visualization used on the [indicator website](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/sustainability/municipal-solid-waste.html).

There is also one RMarkdown file associated with the indicator that generates the data visualizations and summary statistics.
